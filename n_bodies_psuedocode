function read file p
	# file p should have n lines of 7 columns,
	# each giving the initial variables for one particle
	# col. 1,2,3 is position, col. 4,5,6 is velocity, col. 7 is mass
	for each line
		append columns (1,2,3) as a vector to list x
		append columns (4,5,6) as a vector to list v
		append column 7 to list m
		increase n by one
	do a half back step (optional) to get v -½dt out of sync with x

function half back step
	calculate F
	for each velocity in v using index i
		subtract ½dt*F_i/m_i from v_i
